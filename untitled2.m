BPC:BPC (?Build Pure Clusters?) 
FAS:This is just the adjacency search of the PC algorithm, included here for times when just the adjacency search is needed, as when one is subsequently just going to orient variables pairwise.
FASK
FASK Concatenated
FCI:The FCI algorithm is a constraint-based algorithm that takes as input sample data and optional background knowledge and in the large sample limit outputs an equivalence class of CBNs that (including those with hidden confounders) that entail the set of conditional independence relations judged to hold in the population. It is limited to several thousand variables, and on realistic sample sizes it is inaccurate in both adjacencies and orientations. FCI has two phases: an adjacency phase and an orientation phase.
